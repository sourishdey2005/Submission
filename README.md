UwU Code Generator Project
Welcome to the UwU Code Generator! This project is designed to generate code in various programming languages, including the unique UwU language. You can solve coding problems, recognize errors in your code, and even handle complex problems from platforms like Leetcode. The application is multimodal, meaning you can provide input in multiple ways, such as typing, speaking, or capturing images!

Features:
Multimodal Input:
Write your problem description.
Use voice commands for hands-free input.
Capture an image of handwritten text for code generation.
Code Generation:
Generates code in multiple languages:
UwU Language
Python
JavaScript
And more...
Error Detection:
Detects errors in the code and offers solutions.
Complex Problem Solving:
Capable of solving complex programming problems (including Leetcode challenges).
Installation & Setup:
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uwu-code-generator.git
cd uwu-code-generator
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Setup API Key
In Newsubham.py, line 11, replace the GEMINI_API_KEY with your Gemini API Key:

python
Copy
Edit
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"
4. Run the App
Once everything is set up, run the Streamlit app with:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run Newsubham.py
